        <h3>Welcome to my channel!</h3>
        <p>
            My name is MathNerd92, but you can call me Math or Nerd.

        <p>
            I play games and stream for fun, this is a hobby of mine that I do when I have free time.
            Please be patient with me and feel free to drop suggestions.

            I am trying to stream daily Monday thru Friday starting around 1900 EST.
            Times vary because sometimes life changes things.
            I also try to stream at least once over the weekend.
        </p>
